Breakdown of Scripts for "Peaceful" Agent Training

You'll likely have a few Python scripts, each responsible for a specific phase of the training process.
Script 1: environment_setup.py (or integrated into train_agent.py)

This script (or section of a script) focuses on setting up your custom environment.

What it needs to do:

    Import necessary libraries:
        meltingpot
        shimmy
        stable_baselines3
        gymnasium (if using wrappers explicitly)
        dm_env (for Melting Pot's environment structure)
    Define the allelopathic_harvest scenario:
        Load the allelopathic_harvest substrate from Melting Pot.
        Specify the number of agents (2 in this case).
        Set the maximum episode length (100 to 1000 steps).

Script 2: train_agent.py

This is the main script that orchestrates the training process.

What it needs to do:

    Import necessary libraries:
        stable_baselines3.PPO
        stable_baselines3.common.env_util.make_vec_env (useful for vectorized environments, though not strictly required for 2 agents, good practice)
        callbacks.EvalCallback (if you want to evaluate during training)
        environment_setup (to import your make_peaceful_env function)
        os (for saving models)
    Instantiate the environment:
        Call your make_peaceful_env() function to get the custom environment.
        Consider using make_vec_env if you plan to extend to more parallel environments.
    Configure the PPO agent:
        Define the policy network architecture: policy_kwargs = dict(net_arch=dict(pi=[32, 32], vf=[32, 32])).
        Instantiate the PPO model:
        Python

        model = PPO("MultiInputPolicy", env, verbose=1,
                    policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs,
                    tensorboard_log="./peaceful_ppo_tensorboard/",
                    n_steps=..., # You might need to set this based on your batch size and desired total steps
                    batch_size=..., # Small batch size
                    learning_rate=...) # You might want to experiment with this

        Ensure tensorboard_log is set to a desired directory.
    Start training:
        Call model.learn(total_timesteps=100000) (or 50000-100000 steps).
        You might add callbacks here for saving models periodically or for evaluation.
    Save the trained model:
        After model.learn() completes, save the model: model.save("peaceful_agent_ppo").

Script 3: evaluate_agent.py

This script is for loading your trained agent and observing its behavior.

What it needs to do:

    Import necessary libraries:
        stable_baselines3.PPO
        environment_setup (to import your make_peaceful_env function)
        time (for pausing between steps if you want to visualize)
    Load the trained model:
        model = PPO.load("peaceful_agent_ppo")
    Instantiate the environment for evaluation:
        eval_env = environment_setup.make_peaceful_env()
    Run evaluation episodes:
        Loop for a few episodes (e.g., 5-10).
        For each episode:
            obs, info = eval_env.reset()
            done = False
            total_reward = 0
            punishment_beams_used = 0
            Loop while not done:
                action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True) (Use deterministic=True for evaluation)
                obs, rewards, terminations, truncations, infos = eval_env.step(action)
                total_reward += sum(rewards) (assuming multi-agent reward structure)
                Track punishment beam usage: You'll need to replicate the logic from your reward wrapper to check if the punishment action was taken by any agent in the current step and increment a counter.
                done = any(terminations.values()) or any(truncations.values()) (for multi-agent environments, check all done flags)
                (Optional) eval_env.render() if Melting Pot supports rendering and you want visual feedback.
                (Optional) time.sleep(0.1) to slow down the playback.
            Print the total reward and the number of punishment beams used for the episode.
            eval_env.close() (important to close environments)

Additional Considerations & Possible Helper Scripts:

    callbacks.py (Optional): If you implement custom callbacks for stable_baselines3 (e.g., for saving best models, or specific logging).
    utils.py (Optional): For any helper functions that might be shared across scripts (e.g., a function to parse environment details like action spaces).
    run_tensorboard.sh (or a simple command): A shell script or just a note on how to launch TensorBoard to monitor your training progress:
    Bash

tensorboard --logdir ./peaceful_ppo_tensorboard/
